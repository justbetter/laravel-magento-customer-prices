# Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

You do not need to modify code in your price/sku retriever.

If you were using the Mageplaza Better Tier Price module you now have to implement your update class yourself or upgrade to the [JustBetter Magento 2 Customer Pricing](https://github.com/justbetter/magento2-customer-pricing) module.
See the readme on how you can implement your own updater class, you can use the default class from version 1.x as a template.
